        <h3>Style tag</h3>
        <p>
        A slightly better way to configure look and feel
        is to declare CSS rules in the STYLE tag in the
        header and then refer to the tag by their name, 
        ID, or class This paragraph's style is set by a 
        rule referring to the P tags
        </p>
